# My Portfolio Website

I love the art of storytelling and am also passionate about design, sketching, and building software. This portfolio website was a great opportunity to practice all of these things. It was built using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it has been a great way to showcase my skills and abilities.
